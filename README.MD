# This is our CSE534 project, Ft. Erin O. and Zach D.

## TODO

### Controllers

Controllers are in charge of some of the keys and more importantly are in charge of routing.

### Hosts

Hosts are the hosts, they need to send packets in the correct ways and have proper key generation. For testing purposes I would like to quickly add and remove hosts. Docker might be a must here
