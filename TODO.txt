implement threading:
    cleartext_listen needs to run on its own thread,
    implement get_response
        each ongoing convo in cleartext needs to have a convo identifier (header)
        get response needs to be a like a while queue is not empty, send the frame to the queue of the convo

    each SA needs to run in its own thread
    Some sort of link from an SA in KaY to a thread in SecY
