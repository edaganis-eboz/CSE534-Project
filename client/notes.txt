        What MACsec Protects:

MACsec encrypts and protects most of the Ethernet frame's payload, including:

    The payload (data) portion of the Ethernet frame. I.e. IP header & TCP header
    Some of the Layer 2 headers, like the EtherType.
    The optional VLAN tags (if present in the frame).

What MACsec Does Not Encrypt:

    MAC addresses: The source and destination MAC addresses remain in plaintext because they are essential for Layer 2 switching and routing.
    SecTAG (Security Tag): This is a special tag added to the frame to carry MACsec-related information like the Secure Channel Identifier (SCI) and packet numbering for replay protection. The SecTAG is also sent in the clear.
    The integrity check value (ICV) that ensures data integrity.

    Afterwards,
it (KaY) creates and maintains secure channels (SCs) between the
MACsec peers that are used by the SecY to transmit and re-
ceive network packets. SCs are sender-specific, unidirectional,
point-to-multipoint channels. Each SC holds multiple secure
associations (SAs) that have a secure association key (SAK)
used for encrypting, decrypting, and authenticating packets
